Sorry about node_modules/. You don't need to download this. You can create the node_modules/ file on your own computer by typing the following codes into your PowerShell terminal.

Step-1:

npm install @openzeppelin/contracts  //=> install openzeppelin contracts

npm install @truffle/contract   //=> install truffle contracts

Step-2:

npm audit fix   //=> we have to fix security bugs in contracts

npm audit fix --force   //=> we have to fix most critical security bugs in contracts
